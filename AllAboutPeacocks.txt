In all the animal kingdom, the peacock has the fanciest clothing. Male peacocks have beautiful long tail feathers, called a covert or train. Peacocks can spread these tail feathers into a fan. The fans are covered with sparkling circles, or eyes, in purple, red or yellow. The feathers are usually blue or green. Male peacocks use these feathery displays to get a date. The female peacocks seem to prefer the males with the largest, brightest fans.
