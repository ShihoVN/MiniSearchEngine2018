Mini Search Engine: 
This project will analyse a file with multiple websites and create a database. Then, users
can perform a search to print out the URL in order appropriately to the search. The goal of this project is to efficiently build a database and operate a reasonable search engine. In this process, we are to use either a treemap or a treeset along with a priority queue. When a search is performed, we assumed that there will only be one “or” as the keyword connector, representing “a disjunction between the clauses on the left and right” ( Plotnick,  2). We also restricted that each keyword must be separated by a connector including “and,” so the program will print out the websites that contained the most keywords. User is also allowed to have a “-” symbolizing a negation to that word. This negation has the highest priority so the url containing this word will have the lowest priority. Consequently, this program is a miniature search engine.
